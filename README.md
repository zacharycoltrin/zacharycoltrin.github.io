Hello, I'm Zach, and I'm a 18 year old college student. I am currently enrolled in my first year at BSU. A couple interesting facts about me include: I've been to Japan and gotten to do a homestay exchange student program there for 2 weeks, I've had surgery 3 total times, and I used to be wheelchair bound because of the surgeries.
